///$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$         Static Vs Dynamic websites      $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$////
A static website is one with stable content, where every user sees the exact same thing on each individual page.
On the other hand, a dynamic website is one where content is pulled on-the-fly, allowing its content to change with the user.

///$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$         Static Vs Dynamic language      $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$///
 Dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time.
 statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not.
 Dynamically-typed languages are more flexible and can save you time and space when writing scripts. However, this can lead to issues at runtime .
